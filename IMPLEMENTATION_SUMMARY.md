## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Identity Protection System
- **Internal Codenames**: Auto-generated unique VIP identifiers (VIP + 6 chars)
- **Tiered Access Control**: 
  - Operations Staff → See only codenames
  - Operations Admin → See actual names when needed
  - Management/Super Admin → Full visibility
- **Encryption Ready**: VIP name encryption capability (setup available)
- **Compartmentalized Information**: Strict need-to-know access

### Role-Based Access Control
| Role | Flight Requests | VIP Profiles | Special Permissions |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Source of Request** | Create/view own | View assigned VIPs | Upload passenger lists |
| **VIP** | View own requests | View own profile | - |
| **Operations Staff** | View/process all | See codenames only | Upload flight briefs |
| **Operations Admin** | Full management | Full VIP management | Delete requests, manage users |
| **Management** | Read-only oversight | Full visibility | - |
| **Super Admin** | Complete access | Complete access | All operations |

### Data Protection
- **Soft Deletes**: No permanent data loss across the system
- **Audit Logging**: Every action tracked with user, timestamp, IP
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive business rules enforcement
- **Permission Checks**: Granular access control on all endpoints
