# Security & Access Control

## Role-Based Access Control

### Source of Request Users
- Can create flight requests for assigned VIP profiles
- Can view only their own requests
- Can upload passenger lists for completed requests
- Cannot update request status

### VIP Users
- Can view requests made on their behalf
- Cannot create or modify requests directly

### Operations Staff
- Can view all flight requests
- Can update request status
- Can upload flight briefs
- Cannot delete requests
- See only VIP codenames during daily operations

### Operations Admin
- All operations staff permissions
- Can delete flight requests (soft delete)
- Can manage VIP profiles and relationships
- Access actual VIP identities when operationally necessary

### Management
- Read-only access to all requests for oversight
- Full visibility into VIP profile details

### Super Admin
- Full system access
- Can perform all operations

## Identity Protection Features

### VIP Profile Security
- **Internal Codenames:** Auto-generated unique codes (e.g., VIP8K2N1X)
- **Tiered Access:** Different visibility levels based on user role
- **Encrypted Storage:** Actual names can be encrypted in the database (requires encryption key setup)

### Access Control
- **Operations Staff:** See only codenames during daily operations
- **Operations Admin:** Access actual identities when operationally necessary
- **Management/Super Admin:** Full visibility for oversight

### Audit Logging
All VIP profile and flight request actions are automatically logged with:
- User who performed the action
- Action type (create, update, delete)
- Timestamp and IP address
- Resource details

# Business Rules & Validation

## Flight Request Rules
1. **Request Numbering**: Sequential format `001/YYYY`
2. **Time Logic**: Only departure OR arrival time allowed, not both
3. **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping requests for same VIP on same date
4. **Weekend Restrictions**: Weekend flights require special authorization
5. **Security Clearance**: Certain destinations require higher clearance levels
6. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged for compliance
7. **Soft Deletes**: No data is permanently removed

## VIP Profile Rules
1. **Codename Generation:** Automatic unique codename generation (VIP + 6 random alphanumeric characters)
2. **Default Status:** New profiles default to "active" status
3. **JSON Preferences:** Preferences are stored as JSON fields for flexibility
4. **Soft Deletes:** Profiles are never permanently deleted, only marked as deleted
5. **Role-based Serialization:** Response data is customized based on user's access level

## Status Workflow

```
sent → received → under_review → under_process → done
  ↓       ↓           ↓              ↓
unable  unable      unable        unable
```

## Alert System

The system generates alerts for requests approaching flight time:
- 72 hours before flight
- 48 hours before flight  
- 24 hours before flight
- 12 hours before flight
- 6 hours before flight
